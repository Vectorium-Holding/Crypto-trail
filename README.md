## Contribution Guidelines

To maintain a structured workflow, please follow these contribution rules:

1. **Branching Strategy**  
   - The `main` branch is protected, and no direct commits should be made to it.  
   - All changes should be made on individual feature branches.  

2. **Pull Request (PR) Process**  
   - Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix based on `main`.  
   - Once your changes are ready, create a **Pull Request (PR) to `abhinay-branch`** instead of `main`.  
   - Tag @Abhinay for review and approval.  
   - After the review, Abhinay will merge the changes into `main`.  

3. **Code Review & Approval**  
   - Ensure your code follows project guidelines and passes all necessary tests.  
   - Provide a clear description of your changes in the PR.  
   - Address review comments if any modifications are requested.  

This process ensures quality control and smooth integration of new features into the main branch.  
Happy coding! ðŸš€
